<h2>How To Make Tiramisu</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare Coffee Mixture: </strong>Mix the cooled coffee with 2 tablespoons of sugar. Set aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the Mascarpone Cream: </strong>In a bowl, beat the egg yolks with 1 tablespoon of sugar until creamy and smooth.Add the mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract to the yolk mixture. Mix until well combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Whip Egg Whites: </strong>In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the mascarpone mixture until well combined. Be careful not to deflate the mixture.</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble the Tiramisu: </strong>Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture, making sure not to soak them too long. Arrange a layer of dipped ladyfingers in the bottom of a serving dish. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers. Add another layer of dipped ladyfingers on top. Spread the remaining mascarpone mixture over the second layer of ladyfingers.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill and Serve: </strong>Cover and refrigerate the Tiramisu for at least 4 hours, or overnight for best results. Before serving, dust the top with cocoa powder.</li>
